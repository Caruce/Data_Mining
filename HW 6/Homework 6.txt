Problem 8.1: Personal Loan Acceptance.

You may perform the pivot table in any software of your choosing, presumably Excel or R (as done in code posted in Ch. 8 module.) Do not bother to partition the data into training/validation sets.

For part (g), be sure that your variables are declared as factors like we discussed at the top of the R code for the flight delays example in class last Thursday. Otherwise, you may have erroneous results that don't match your work in part (e).

As always, you may work with a partner on this assignment.
