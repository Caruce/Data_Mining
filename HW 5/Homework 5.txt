Consider the quest for the perfect cookie in this puzzlOR (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. The data for the problem is stored in the attached data shellPreview the document. Though none are perfect, we¡¯ll call a cookie Good if it achieves a score of 80 or better. For each new test recipe a, b, & c, compute the distance between it and each of the other recipes in the training set. Use a k-nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate for each test recipe both the (i) score and (ii) probability of being good; i.e., we want to perform both a kNN regression and classification. (In case of ties - common with integer data - include all records within rank k.) Try values of k = 4, 8, and 15. Do you notice a pattern as k increases? Which test cookie recipe appears best?
