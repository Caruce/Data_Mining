Problem 10.1 Financial Condition of Banks.

You may run the logistic regression in any software of your choosing: Minitab, R, SPSS, etc. (Note to use only the two predictors described in the problem; there is a third that you should ignore.) Copy this regression output to your report. Report on the statistical significance or not of the two predictors at a level of significance of alpha = 0.05 (trickier in Minitab). Also comment on the overall goodness of fit of the model.

Do all parts of the problem with some modifications to following parts:

In part (a) just write the logit equation from your model (part i). 

In part (d) since all the data for this ratio measure range only between 0.3 and about 1, it makes more sense to interpret an increase of 0.1 units rather than a whole unit. Reinterpret the odds of being financially weak for a 0.1 unit increase in this total loans/leases to total assets ratio.

(dx) Roughly check your latter answer in part (d) by comparing the odds of bank 5 being weaker than the new bank in part (b). 

Type up your answers in a report for upload by due date/time. (If you are inserting any math equations in MS Word, it will be best for viewing here if you save as a pdf rather than doc file.) You may work with a homework partner as always.
