Problem 2.11. In part (b)(i) "Metallic" should read "Color". Of course, there is a third categorical variable, "Model," which has hundreds of unique text strings; delete this second column from the data.

Problem 4.3. (Problem 4.4 in XLMiner book) For the correlation matrix in part (e), create a heatmap of the result as shown in the Ch3.R codes. Also therein (Figure 3.7) is an indication of a so-called matrix scatterplot.

Note: The problems ask you to use R software; if reading the XLMiner based book, replace the words Excel and XLMiner with R. There is a dummies package that you can install in R as shown in Table 2.6 of the Ch2.R codes. (This easier option does not appear in the textbook.)

Note:In RStudio, knit (under File menu) your code/output into a word document. You may then type up your short answers to the questions and include in the document for upload. (No need to print or write down on paper.)

Nota Bene (NB): You may work with a partner on this assignment. If doing so, only one of you will need upload your R code. In order to do so, please create a student group for you and your partner under People section (Homework Partners groups) here in Canvas.
